# Iska Utils - Command Macros

This directory allows you to create command macros that can be executed directly in the game.

All commands are reloadable by /reload or better verison provided by this mod
/reloader, so you can modify them at any time, if you change a default generated file set overwritable to false in the file.

## Format

```json

    - `stage_type` can be: "player" (default), "world", or "team"
    - `is`: Whether the stage must be present (`true`, default) or absent (`false`)
- `parameters`: Array of parameter definitions for the command [optional]
  - `type`: Type of parameter (`string`, `word`, `int`, `float`, `double`, `boolean`, `target`, `static`) [**required**]
  - `required`: Whether the parameter is required (true) or optional (false) [optional, default: true]

- `float`/`double`: A decimal number
- `boolean`: true or false
- `target`: Player selector (e.g., @p, @a, or player name)
- `static`: Value from a predefined list with autocomplete (like vanilla command arguments)

### Parameter Usage in Commands
Parameters can be used in commands using `#index` notation where index is the parameter's position (0-based).
For example, `#0` refers to the first parameter, `#1` to the second, etc.
You can escape the # character by using ##, which will be converted to a single # in the command.

### Game Stages
The game stages system allows you to lock macros behind progression milestones. There are three types of stages:

- **Player Stages**: Related to individual player progression (default type)
- **World Stages**: Related to global world state or events
- **Team Stages**: Related to the player's team progression

You can specify the stage type using the `stage_type` field in each stage requirement.

### Sub-Command Implementation
You can implement sub-commands using the static parameter type and conditional execution with stages. Here's a complete example of how to create a powerful recursive sub-command system:

```json
{
  "type": "iska_utils:commands_macro",
  "overwritable": false,
  "commands": [
    {
      "command": "sub_command",
      "level": 0,
      "stages_logic": "DEF_AND",
      "stages": [
        {"stage": "sub_command_condition_0", "stage_type": "player", "is": true},
        {"stage": "sub_command_condition_1", "stage_type": "player", "is": true},
        {"stage": "sub_command_condition_2", "stage_type": "player", "is": true},

        {"stage": "sub_command_condition_0", "stage_type": "player", "is": false},
        {"stage": "sub_command_condition_1", "stage_type": "player", "is": false},
        {"stage": "sub_command_condition_2", "stage_type": "player", "is": false}
      ],
      "parameters": [
          {
            "type": "static",
            "list": [
              {"declare": "condition_0"},
              {"declare": "condition_1"},
              {"declare": "condition_2"}
            ]
          }
        ],

      "do": [
      {"if": [
        {"conditions":[3,4,5]},
        {"execute": "iska_utils_stage add player @s sub_command_#0 true"},
        {"delay": 5},
        {"execute": "sub_commad #0"}
      ]},
        {"if": [
            {"conditions": [0]},
            {"execute": "tellraw @s \"condition_0\""},
            {"execute": "iska_utils_stage remove player @s sub_command_#0 true"}
        ]},
        {"if": [
            {"conditions": [1]},
            {"execute": "tellraw @s \"condition_1\""},
            {"execute": "iska_utils_stage remove player @s sub_command_#0 true"}
        ]},
        {"if": [
            {"conditions": [2]},
            {"execute": "tellraw @s \"condition_1\""},
            {"execute": "iska_utils_stage remove player @s sub_command_#0 true"}
        ]}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This advanced pattern works by:
1. Defining a command with a static parameter that offers multiple sub-command options (`condition_0`, `condition_1`, `condition_2`)
2. Using the `DEF_AND` stages logic for deferred evaluation of conditions
3. Leveraging both positive and negative stage conditions:
   - Indexes 0-2: Positive conditions checking if stages are present
   - Indexes 3-5: Negative conditions checking if stages are absent
4. Using recursion for efficient handling:
   - The first `if` block checks if no stages are active (negative conditions)
   - It then adds the appropriate stage and recursively calls itself
   - On the second call, one of the positive condition blocks will match
   - The matching block executes its command and cleans up by removing the stage

The key advantages of this approach:
- Clean recursive implementation that separates stage setting from execution
- Only one stage is active at a time, preventing conflicts
- Tab completion for sub-commands comes built-in
- Easy to add new sub-commands by extending the static list and adding corresponding conditions
- Each sub-command has its own dedicated code block for maximum flexibility

Additionally, you can use the `is` field to create negative requirements:
- `"is": true` (default): The player/world/team MUST have the specified stage
- `"is": false`: The player/world/team MUST NOT have the specified stage

This allows you to create conditions like "player must have stage A but must not have stage B".

### Conditional Execution with IF
The IF action type allows you to conditionally execute commands based on specific stage conditions.
When using `DEF_AND` or `DEF_OR` stage logic, you can use the `if` action type in your `do` array:

```json
{"if": [
    {"conditions": [0, 2]},
    {"execute": "say condition met"}
]}
```

The `conditions` array contains indices that refer to the stages defined in the command's `stages` array.
In the example above, the command will execute only if stages at index 0 and 2 are satisfied.

With `DEF_AND` logic, ALL specified conditions must be met.
With `DEF_OR` logic, ANY ONE of the specified conditions must be met.

## Notes

- Commands are executed in the context of the player who triggered the macro
- If executed by a command block, the position of the command block is used
- Changes require a game restart to apply
- For security reasons, macros are limited to players with the appropriate permission level
- When macros with the same command name are found in multiple files:
  - If a file has `overwritable: false`, its macros cannot be overwritten
  - If a file has `overwritable: true` or no overwritable field, its macros can be overwritten by later files
  - Files are processed in alphabetical order

## Default Commands Macro

The mod automatically generates a file called `default_commands_macro.json` with some example macros.
- This file has `overwritable: true` by default, which means it will be regenerated on each start
- If you want to keep your changes to this file, set `overwritable: false`
- Best practice: Instead of editing the default file, create your own files with custom macros

## Example Use Cases

### Reload Scripts and Configurations
A macro that reloads various mod systems with appropriate delays between commands.

### Parametrized Commands
Commands like `/echo Hello World` or `/msg player1 Hello there` that take parameters.

### Static Parameter Commands
Custom commands with tab-completion like `/spawnmob zombie` or `/setbiome desert` that provide convenient shortcuts with predefined options.

### Progression-Based Commands
Commands that are only available once players have reached certain milestones or completed specific quests.

### Per-Action Stage Requirements with DEF_AND and DEF_OR

#### DEF_AND Example
Using `DEF_AND` means each action requires ALL of its stage conditions to be met:

```json
{
  "command": "dungeon_rewards",
  "level": 0,
  "stages_logic": "DEF_AND",
  "stages": [
    {"stage": "dungeon_boss_defeated", "stage_type": "player", "is": true},
    {"stage": "dungeon_curse", "stage_type": "player", "is": false},
    {"stage": "dungeon_secret_found", "stage_type": "player", "is": true}
  ],
  "do": [
    {
      "execute": "say Welcome to the dungeon rewards system!"
    },
    {
      "if": [
        {"conditions": [0, 1]},
        {"execute": "give @s minecraft:diamond 5"}
      ]
    },
    {
      "if": [
        {"conditions": [0, 2]},
        {"execute": "give @s minecraft:netherite_ingot 1"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example:
- The first action always executes (no conditions)
- The second action only executes if conditions 0 and 1 are met (player has beaten the boss AND does NOT have the curse)
- The third action only executes if conditions 0 and 2 are met (player has beaten the boss AND found the secret)

#### DEF_OR Example
Using `DEF_OR` means each action requires ANY of its stage conditions to be met:

```json
{
  "command": "guild_benefits",
  "level": 0,
  "stages_logic": "DEF_OR",
  "stages": [
    {"stage": "guild_healer", "stage_type": "player", "is": true},
    {"stage": "guild_tank", "stage_type": "player", "is": true},
    {"stage": "guild_warrior", "stage_type": "player", "is": true}
  ],
  "do": [
    {
      "execute": "say Guild Benefits System Activated!"
    },
    {
      "if": [
        {"conditions": [0]},
        {"execute": "effect give @s minecraft:regeneration 60 1"}
      ]
    },
    {
      "if": [
        {"conditions": [1]},
        {"execute": "effect give @s minecraft:resistance 60 1"}
      ]
    },
    {
      "if": [
        {"conditions": [2]},
        {"execute": "effect give @s minecraft:strength 60 1"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example:
- The first action always executes (no conditions)
- The second action executes if the player has the "guild_healer" stage
- The third action executes if the player has the "guild_tank" stage
- The fourth action executes if the player has the "guild_warrior" stage

The key difference between these examples is how the stage conditions are evaluated for each action:
- With `DEF_AND`, each action requires ALL of its conditions to be met
- With `DEF_OR`, each action requires ANY ONE of its conditions to be met
